## Projects

|2017| ASELSAN MW Wind Turbine| Feasibility analysis and design of a MW sized direct-drive wind turbine generator.|
|2016-2017| ASELSAN Rail-Gun Project| Electromagnetic Design and Optimization of a 200kJ-2MJ Electromagnetic Launcher.|
|2016| BAP| Design of a Modular Data Acqusition Board.|
|2016| Andar Servo| Design and Manufacturing of a Eddy Current Damper for Aeorospace Application|
|2016| Andar Servo| Design and Manufacturing of a Brushless PM Servo Motor.|
|2015 | Newton Fund Mobility Grant | Design of a superconducting wind turbine prototype.|
|2014–2016 | TUBITAK 2232 Project | Design of modular and fault-tolerant generators for direct-drive wind turbines.|
|2011–2014 | EU FP7 Project | [Marina Platform](http://www.marina-platform.info/) Project is an EU FP7 project with 17 industrial and academic partners. I am working as a full-time researcher in the project, which aims to design combined wave and wind energy platforms. My duty is to compare different generator topologies and power take-off systems in terms of efficiency and reliability.|
|2013 | United Arab Emirates Uni. | Design of a 5 kW permanent-magnet linear generator test rig.|
|2013 | [GE Power Conversion](http://www.gepowerconversion.com/) | A project to validate the superconducting generator topology that I developed during my PhD. General Electric supplied the superconducting coil and test facilities for the cryogenic tests.|
|2011 | [NGenTec](http://www.ngentec.com/) | Design consultant for a medium-speed generator design. Electromagnetic optimization a 5 MW, 300 rpm permanent-magnet generator has been completed.|
|2010 | [NGenTec](http://www.ngentec.com/) | Design and optimization of a 1 MW, 12 rpm direct-drive generator for a wind turbine. The machine has been manufactured and successfully tested.|
|2010 | SMART R&D Grant | Design and testing of a 25 kW axial flux permanent-magnet generator. The experimental results have been used to evaluate the thermal performance of the generator and the cooling system.|
|2010 | [Hayward Tyler](http://www.haywardtyler.com/) | Feasibility analysis of a submerged and flooded permanent-magnet generator. Thermal performance of the flooded generator has been investigated as well as the corrosion mechanisms and fluid drag losses.|
|2009–2010 | NPower Project | The feasibility analysis of direct-drive PM generators for two wave energy converters ([Aquamarine Power](http://www.aquamarinepower.com/),[AWS Ocean Power](http://www.awsocean.com)) and two tidal energy converters ([Marine Current Turbines](http://www.marineturbines.com/), [Scotrenewables](http://www.scotrenewables.com/)) have been investigated. An analytical and optimization tool is developed, and licensed by University of Edinburgh for further use.|
|2005–2008 | [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr) | A novel method to estimate the rotor speed and position of an induction motor using the fringing flux out of the rotor cage is developed. An international patent has been awarded to this work.|
