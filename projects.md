## Ongoing Projects

|2018-2019| USTDA | **USA Trade and Development Agency, METU Smart Campus Project:** This project is the only funded project from the [Smart Cities](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/96b21c_3c398c840786434e9a3362c733396559.pdf) call of 2016. In the project, feasibility analysis of smart city concepts for METU will be investigated. These include roof-top PVs, electric shuttle bus, electric bike network, smart LED lighting, combined heat and power generation facilities. The project aims to make METU campus a sustainable, self-sufficient green campus. Project has been [signed](https://www.ustda.gov/news/press-releases/2017/ustda-supports-metu-smart-campus-technical-assistance-grant) in September 2017, and it is expected to be completed in April 2019. *Project budget: $830.000*.|
|2017-2018| TUBITAK 3501 | **Development of a 7,5 kW Permanent Magnet Integrated Modular Motor Drive System:** The aim of this project is to develop an IMMD system where the electric motor and its drive are integrated into a single package. The motor and drive will consist of several modules to increase fault tolerance.  Gallium Nitride (GaN) power semiconductor devices will be used to reduce the size and increase the efficiency. *Project budget: 177.000 TL*.|
|2016-2017| ASELSAN SST | **Electromagnetic Design and Optimization of a 10 MJ Electromagnetic Launcher - Phase II:** Second phase of the [TUFAN](http://www.millisavunma.com/aselsan-tufan-elektromanyetik-top-sistemi/) railgun project in which a 10 MJ prototype will be tested. Detailed 3D FEA models are developed to obtain electrical, mechanical force, and thermal characteristics of the railgun. *Project budget: 392.000 TL*.|

## Completed Projects

|2017-2018| ASELSAN MGEO | **Design of a high performance linear servo actuator and PCB Motor:** Two high performance actuators (linear and axial flux permanent magnet) will be designed and manufactured in this project. The aim is to manufacture these actuators in Turkey instead of exporting. *Project budget: 198.000 TL*.|
|2017-2018| EnerjiSa-H2020 Project | **Pattern Recognition in Power Systems:** The aim of [EPR Project](http://europeanpatternrecognition.eu/) is to implement pattern recognition techniques for power systems to detect faults and plan predictive maintenance on system components. METU's work packages consist of  [synthetic inertia implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_52WUWsKuXA&feature=youtu.be) in wind turbines to improve power system stability and analyze distribution level power quality to detect anomalies. *Total Project budget: € 2.400.000*.|
|2017| ASELSAN UGES | **Feasibility analysis and design of a 2.5MW direct-drive wind turbine generator:** In this project techno-economic analysis of different generator technologies are performed to find the most suitable generator technology for ASELSAN. A detailed electromagnetic, structural and thermal optimization of a direct-drive generator using FEA tools is presented. *Project budget: 87.000TL*.|
|2016-2017| ASELSAN SST | **Electromagnetic Design and Optimization of a 200kJ-2MJ Electromagnetic Launcher:** In this project electromagnetic and thermal analyses are performed on the [TUFAN](http://www.millisavunma.com/aselsan-tufan-elektromanyetik-top-sistemi/) railgun project. Detailed 3D FEA models are developed to obtain electrical, mechanical force, and thermal characteristics of the railgun. *Project budget: 397.000 TL*.|
