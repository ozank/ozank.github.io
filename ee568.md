## Brief Info:
This course covers basic design principles of electromechanical energy conversion, magnetic circuits and permanent magnets. Modern electric machine types such as  permanent magnet (PM) machines, synchronous reluctance machines, axial flux machines, direct-drive machines will be covered. You will be able to design an electrical machine analytically and  verify your designs using finite-element methods. Coupled design methods considering thermal and structural design will be also covered.
