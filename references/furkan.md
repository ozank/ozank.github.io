### Reference Letter for Furkan Karakaya

### 15/12/2019

To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Mr. Furkan Karakaya for his PhD application in MIT. Furkan got his BSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of METU in 2017, with an CGPA of 3.61 of 4.00. It should be noted that our department accepts only top %0.1 students from Turkey to its undergraduate programs. Last year, among more than 1.8 million applicants of the university entrance exam, only 200 students in the top 2000 have been accepted to the B.Sc Program of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department. Furthermore, our department has been evaluated among the world’s best 200 Electrical-Electronics Engineering Departments in the world in QS ([more information](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/engineering-electrical-electronic)). 

I know Furkan for over four years from several undergraduate classes and as his MSc supervisor.   He became an active member of our research group [PowerLab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr) in METU, after he graduated. Furkan is always curious and would like challenges and push his limits further by improving his knowledge in every aspects of his research topic. Furkan is really quick in learning new concepts, and combining her theoretical background with practical concepts. He first joined as a researcher to a project called "Design of a 8 kW Integrated Modular Motor Drive with GaN transistors", in which he improved his knowledge both in power electronics hardware and also in motor design and control. He contributed to the project by designing complex PCB circuits for the 2 kW GaN inverter and also working on the switching characteristics of the GaN transistors. He has the experience and dedication to design, improve, implement the designs and also verify these designs without external help in the laboratory with confidence. 

He always has the motivation to learn new things and works independently. In order to improve his skills, he completed a seven course online program on [Power Electronics on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/power-electronics) instructed by Prof. Robert Erickson. He the got accepted to a three months summer fellowship in EPFL with Prof. Elison Matioli. He managed to publish a journal paper in his visit in a short time. I have to emphasize that all these were possible due to determination and initiative of Furkan.	

He got a teaching assistant position in METU in 2019. Since then, he channeled his skills to improve the undergraduate classes and laboratories. He is the coordinator for 4th year undergraduate [power electronics course](https://github.com/odtu/ee463), this semester he led the software and hardware project assignments and put lots of effort to improve the experiments and laboratory manual. His communication with students are always excellent and he enjoys helping students and transfer his skills.   

He is a very organized, problem-solver type of person and has the analytical skills to work independently and be successful in a PhD project. I am sure he will be a very dedicated and responsible team member and has the analytical skills to success in challenging research projects. He is also very good at teaching and presenting. I therefore strongly recommend Mr. Furkan Karakaya to be accepted to the PhD program in MIT. Based on my personal experience, I believe that he will be very successful researcher in his field. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further questions.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Ozan Keysan
