### Reference Letter for Gökhan Çakal

### 07/01/2020

To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Mr. Gökhan Çakal for his PhD application in University of Nottingham. Gökhan got his BSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of METU in 2017, with an CGPA of 3.38 of 4.00. It should be noted that our department accepts only top %0.1 students from Turkey to its undergraduate programs. Last year, among more than 1.8 million applicants of the university entrance exam, only 200 students from the top 2000 have been accepted to the B.Sc Program of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department. Furthermore, our department has been evaluated among the world’s best 200 Electrical-Electronics Engineering Departments in the world in QS ([more information](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/engineering-electrical-electronic)). 

I know Gökhan for over four years from several undergraduate classes and as his MSc supervisor. While he was in his undergraduate, Gökhan volunteered to join the [STAR projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), a program that aims to get undergraduate students participated in research projects with faculty members. The students volunteer to join in research projects without any obligation. Gökhan practiced using  a commercial hardware in the loop (HIL) system (SpeedGoat) on motor driver controllers. After completing his BSc, he became an active member of our research group [PowerLab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr) in METU. 

He first worked as a research assistant on a project on designing a printed-circuit-board(PCB) motor for a high performance position control for a gimbal application. Gökhan successfully designed the motor both analytically and validated the design by using 3D FEA software (ANSYS Maxwell). He then implemented a genetic algorithm optimization in MATLAB and came up with an optimal design which is manufactured and the experimental results proved his analytical models. Gökhan then implemented a reduced torque ripple rotary voice coil motor for an aerospace application larger gimbal that requires sensitive position control.

In his MSc thesis, Gökhan worked on a novel axial flux permanent-magnet machine. The idea, which is mainly developed by Gökhan, is to manufacture the stator windings from aluminum or copper sheets cut in to special shapes with laser or water-jet cutters. The topology brings ease of manufacturing, especially for automated production. The topology also improves the thermal performance of the machine as the stator itself behaves like a heat-sink. Gökhan successfully developed analytical and FEA models for this novel topology, always pushing his limits improving his theoretic knowledge in the field and his practical knowledge in manufacturing and experimental techniques.  es  with Gökhan is always curious and would like challenges and push his limits further by improving his knowledge in every aspects of his research topic. Gökhan is a quick learner and is able to work independently and combine his theoretical knowledge with the practical concepts. He led the patent application for the machine topology he developed in his MSc project, and he prepared two conference and a journal paper from his project so far. 

He is also employed as a teaching assistant in the department since 2018. Since then, he helps the undergraduate students and teaches in the laboratory sessions. He was the coordinator for 3rd year undergraduate [electromechanical energy conversion](http://keysan.me/) and 4th year undergraduate [power electronics course](https://github.com/odtu/ee463) always with very positive feedback from the students. He took initiative to improve the courses, software projects and laboratory session throughout the semester. He always has the motivation to learn new things and works independently. In order to improve his skills, he completed a seven course online program on [Power Electronics on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/power-electronics) instructed by Prof. Robert Erickson. 

Gökhan is very good at analytical thinking and approaching a problem systematically. He works independently, in a structured and dedicated way that helps him to crack any difficult problem he faced in his research projects. I am sure he will be a very hardworking and responsible team member and he gained enough theoretical and practical expertise in the field of electrical machines to be successful in his PhD in University of Nottingham. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further questions.

Yours Sincerely,
