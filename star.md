[EEE STAR](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/) program is created to provide EEE undergraduate students an opportunity to be a part of the various research groups in the department and conduct cutting-edge research, whether you join an established research group and contribute to the work, or pursue your own ideas.

For more information please visit the [official project webpage](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/).

Here are a few projects that I offer this year:

If you are planning to choose one of these projects, please feel free to  come and visit me (I am mostly in C-114) to ask any questions. Then please fill the application form using this link: [http://goo.gl/forms/OCBGSDv0tL](http://goo.gl/forms/OCBGSDv0tL), so I can keep a track of applications.

## 1- 3D Printed Electric Motors

The aim of this project is to manufacture novel electric motors(or transformers, inductors) using 3D printers instead of conventional manufacturing methods. [Magnetic Iron PLA](http://www.proto-pasta.com/pages/magnetic-iron-pla) materials will be used in the project. Students with an experience in mechanical drawign software and 3D printers are preferred.

## 2- Design of a Tethered Quad-copter for Continuous Flying:

Flying time of [quad-copters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter) is limited to 10-15 minutes due to battery capacity. Although, a ground powered quad-copter can fly continuously and perform its mission (ie image processing, continuous video recording) for extended periods. In this project, you will design a power supply and transmission cable for a ground powered quad-copter. The aim is to minimize the mass of the transmission wire, thus it is necessary to design a step-up power converter (ie. use thinner wire using high-voltage, low current).

**What you will learn:** Design of a step-up, step-down power supply. How to handle the harmonics in a long transmission cable. Optimization algorithms to choose the best design parameters.

**Requirements:** Basic power electronics and PCB manufacturing knowledge is required.

## 3- Robot Control with a Smart Glove

The main idea of the project is to control a robot using  a smart glove. In the project both hardware and software will be implemented. Therefore, it is preferred to have some experience in PCB design (Eagle, Proteus etc), ambition on communication protocols(I2C,SPI) and data filtering. This project will be developed in collaboration with [BAMA](http://www.bamateknoloji.com)

**Requirements:** Basic microcontroller and programming knowledge is required.

## 4- Basic Railgun/Coilgun Implementation

A [coilgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coilgun) or Gauss gun is a type of projectile accelerator consisting of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a linear motor that accelerate a ferromagnetic or conducting projectile to high velocity. You have two options in this project:

a) Development of an experimental setup to demosntrate basics of a coil cun

b) Finite-element modelling of a rail gun using [Comsol](https://www.comsol.com/)

## 5- Wireless Battery Charger

Wireless battery charging or wireless inductive charging as it is also called, is a method for transferring electrical energy from a charger to a device without the need for a physical wire connection. The aim of this project is to design and implement a battery charger which can charge a 3.2V Li-Ion battery wirelessly from a 24V DC supply. The charger should also indicate the voltage level of the battery.

**What you will learn:** Battery charger technology, wireless power transfer, PCB design and manufacturing

**Requirements:** Basic power converter knowledge, basic PCB design experience, magnetic design knowledge

## 6- Power supply for a data acquisition and monitoring system:

Data acquisition devices are widely used in power systems for monitoring and control purposes. The aim of this project is to design and implement an isolated 50W power supply with multiple outputs (15V and 24V) which is fed from the mains (230V AC). This power supply is intended to be used on a data acquisition and monitoring device.

**What you will learn:**  DC power supplies, isolated DC/DC converter, PCB design and manufacturing

**Requirements:** Basic power converter knowledge, basic PCB design experience

## 7- Data acquisition and monitoring system software:

The aim of this project is to implement a software on [Raspberry Pi2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) for a data acquisition and monitoring device to be used on power systems. The software should include data acquisition from several analog inputs, real-time data visualisation, processing and recording. This project will be in collaboration with [OpenLab Tools](http://www.openlabtools.org/)

**What you will learn:**  Graphical user interfaces (GUI), real-time data acquisition systems, Internet of things, Linux

**Requirements:** Basic programming experience

## 8- Auto-tuning of the control system of a DC/DC converter:

Conventional offline design of controllers for DC/DC power converters is complicated by unknown load characteristics, as well as uncertainties within the converter itself. Controllers with auto-tuning capability have the advantage of overcoming such issues. The aim of this project is to implement an auto-tuning algorithm on a digital control environment (such as Digital Signal Controllers) to be used on a simple low power DC/DC buck converter. The converter is also to be designed and implemented.

**What you will learn:** DC/DC converters, digital control of power electronics devices, PCB design and manufacturing, software implementation of digital control

**Requirements:** Basic power converter knowledge, experience in basic PCB design and embedded software

## 9- Manufacturing of Open Lab Tools

In this project, laboratory measurement equipments (such as torque meter, tachometer) for the Machinery Lab will be designed and manufactured. Students with some experience in programming, PCB manufacturing and 3D printers are preferred. This project will be in collaboration with [OpenLab Tools](http://www.openlabtools.org/).
