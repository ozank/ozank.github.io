# A Guideline for Project Management


In the recent years, the number of research projects within our team has grown consistently, which is good news. Currently, we have 12 funded research projects, and 6 more in the pipeline. Up to now, I struggled to manage all these projects, but I'll be on sabbatical leave in 2025, and I'll need your support to run the projects smoothly in my absence. I believe you can do a better job than I have, since you are the ones doing the actual work in the projects.

As you know, our team was reluctant to use MS Teams, so we decided to organize our work in [GitHub ODTU Team](https://github.com/odtu), and you can find the relevant project and people account links from [Powerlab/Project repo](https://github.com/odtu/Powerlab/tree/master/Projects).

Since the days of using Trello, I aimed to organize your work into weekly tasks, which is one of the main principler of  Kanban project management (details below). While I am not an expert in project management, I try to follow these few principles of Kanban project management:

- Visualize the Workflow (which we do during the weekly meetings and project boards)
- Limit the work in Progress (by dividing the research projects into smaller chunks)
- Measure and Manage Flow (by keeping a track of the completed tasks)
- Continuous Improvement (by coming up new ideas and creating new tasks, unfortunately up to now, new tasks were mainly assigned only by me)


I would like to define the project teams and leaders for each research project. You can find the draft plan from [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qkYq6zdjBHbpaoSGwbdyPhIfrH_-CfYhJKlSbAswA88/edit?usp=sharing). If you are confused about your roles, you can find more explanation below.



## Kanban vs. Scrum

I personally like the Kanban style more but Scrum is also a very popular agile project management method. I'll leave it to project leaders to choose the best suitable method for themselves, but please have start with the following links (more resources below):
