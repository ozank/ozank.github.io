# A Guideline for Project Management


In the recent years, the number of research projects within our team has grown consistently, which is good news. Currently, we have 12 funded research projects, and 6 more in the pipeline. Up to now, I struggled to manage all these projects, but I'll be on sabbatical leave in 2025, and I'll need your support to run the projects smoothly in my absence. I believe you can do a better job than I have, since you are the ones doing the actual work in the projects.

As you know, our team was reluctant to use MS Teams, so we decided to organize our work in [GitHub ODTU Team](https://github.com/odtu), and you can find the relevant project and people account links from [Powerlab/Project repo](https://github.com/odtu/Powerlab/tree/master/Projects).

Since the days of using Trello, I aimed to organize your work into weekly tasks, which is one of the main principler of  Kanban project management (details below). While I am not an expert in project management, I try to follow these few principles of Kanban project management:

- Visualize the Workflow (which we do during the weekly meetings and project boards)
- Limit the work in Progress (by dividing the research projects into smaller chunks)
- Measure and Manage Flow (by keeping a track of the completed tasks)
- Continuous Improvement (by coming up new ideas and creating new tasks, unfortunately up to now, new tasks were mainly assigned only by me)


I would like to define the project teams and leaders for each research project. You can find the draft plan from [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qkYq6zdjBHbpaoSGwbdyPhIfrH_-CfYhJKlSbAswA88/edit?usp=sharing). If you are confused about your roles, you can find more explanation below.



## Kanban vs. Scrum

I personally like the Kanban style more but Scrum is also a very popular agile project management method. I'll leave it to project leaders to choose the best suitable method for themselves, but please have start with the following links (more resources below):

## Product Owner

There are different names for this role such as Service Request Manager (SRM) but this person is the one that coordinates the workflow and assign tasks. He/she will prioritize the workflow, and set limits on current work in progress task by assigning tasks to each team member. Monitoring progress and completion of the tasks are also within his/her responsibility.

You can have a look at the following for more details:

- [Kanban Roles: Everything you need to know](https://leadershiptribe.com/kanban-roles/)
- [Kanban Roles and Responsibilities Explained in Full ](https://businessmap.io/blog/kanban-roles)


## Scrum Master

Not exactly equivalent but scrum master is also called agile coach or service delivery manager (SDM). It is usually the person who facilitates the flow, communication and ensures the team stick to Kanban principles. Although, they may not do the actual work, they help the team by removing obstacles and adjusting team capacity accordingly by analyzing project progress and main metrics.

Team Members

Of course there is a big responsibility for team members as well. We don't have a strict authority and ranks in our research team, and therefore you should do your best to share the responsibility do your best to help your project teams.  There are a few management issues that I believe we can improve.

Team members also carry significant responsibility. Since our research team operates without rigid hierarchies or strict authority, it’s critical for everyone to actively share responsibilities and support their project teams and product owners. I believe there are some management aspects that can be improved:




## Documentation

Documentation is critical aspect in our research projects so that everyone can be on the same page. These are the main issues I see in our team members:

- Not backing up your files, keeping everything in ransom folders in your local PC
- Choosing arbitrary file names, not using proper version control tools, and keeping every unnecessary file just in case
- Insufficient comments/explanations in your codes, or not using a proper naming convention in variables/functions etc.
- Not using README.md files in your GitHub repos or in your main folders


<img src="https://itchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/darth-meme.jpg" alt="Drawing" style="width: 200px;"/>


Please follow the basic rules below, and have a look at all the links below.

- Keep all your files in your GitHub repositories, and make [at least 3 commits per week]() to keep your repo up-to-date
- If a file is redundant or have a newer version delete it. Renaming files and keeping multiple copies in the same folder is not a file versioning method
- Have backups of all your files. Although GitHub repos should be your primary directory, we have a NAS (network-attached-storage) in ARC-301, and you can use synchronization tools such as [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for large files etc. You can also access documents of all past project from this NAS. Please contact me or Özgür for access.
