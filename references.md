## Open Reference Letters

This page is for my open reference letters that I write for the students that I trust and recommend most. The students can ask for a closed reference letter, but they can NOT request to be listed in this page. I choose 1-2 best students every year, and publish their reference letters here, as I have no hesitation in recommending them for graduate programs.
