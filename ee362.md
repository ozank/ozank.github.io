## Lecture Hours

All lectures will be recorded and published [on YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkBWz-xDRrpYb7-jvklqIKA).

There will be also optional synchronous recitation/ Q&A sessions on Mondays 13:40-15:30. These sessions will be recorded and published in the ODTUClass.

## Course Coordinator:

- Furkan Tokgöz
- Office: Ayaslı ARC-300
- Tel: 0312 210 6093
- Email: tokgoz@metu.edu.tr

## Grading:

- One Midterm Exam: 20%
- Final Exam: 30%
- Laboratory/Simulation Projects: 25%
- Homeworks: 20%
- Participation/In Video Questions: 5%

## Laboratory Sessions:

There will be five online asynchronous laboratory sessions. You are required to watch a laboratory session video, and given a practical problem and a Matlab/Simulink simulation template. You'll be required run the simulation file to answer the lab questions and submit a report with a group of three people.

## Course Contents:

The following materials will be available to students:

- Weekly Asynchronous lecture videos (~60-90 min/ week), available [on YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkBWz-xDRrpYb7-jvklqIKA).
- Weekly synchronous recitation hours, recordings will be avaiable on ODTUClass
- Lecture presentations (and annotated copies during lectures)
- Laboratory videos and Matlab/Simulink simulation templates
- Solved problem sets, previous exam solutions
