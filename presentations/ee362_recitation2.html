### A 380 V(l-l) 3-phase 4-pole Y-connected induction motor's torque-speed characteristics can be approximated as:
--

## \\(T\_m = k s = \dfrac{3 V^2}{r'\_2 \omega\_s} s\\)
--

### where \\(r'\_2 = 1 \Omega\\)/phase. The motor is used to drive a load at a preciselt constant speed of 1500 rpm.

The load torque can be expressed as:
### \\(T_L=\omega_r + 10 \\) Nm.

## a) Propose a method of speed control for this purpose and explain your reasoning, and calculate the required controller parameters.
--

## b) Calculate the operating slip of the motor.
--

## c) Give a rough estimate for the efficiency of the motor under these conditions.
--

## d) What is the minimum value of starting torque the motor must produce?

# Q2: Ahmet Rumeli Solved Problems: Q6.5

### A 6-pole, \\(215 \sqrt{3}\\), Y-connected, 60 Hz wound rotor induction motor has the following specifications
--

### Stator impedance: \\(Z\_1 = 0.2 + j0.38 \Omega\\)
### Referred Rotor impedance: \\(Z\_2' = 0.12 + j0.38 \Omega\\) at standstill

### The motor is used as a crane motor, which lifts and lowers a load that produces 160 Nm.


#### Neglect friction. Parallel branch moved to primary terminals

### a) While lifting the load at constant speed, find the stable operating slip?
--

### a2) What is the slip at maximum torque?

### b) While lifting the  load at constant speed, the supply voltage is cut and the load is left to move freely. What happens if the rated voltage is reapplied at slip:
--

### b1) Less than 1.244?
--

### b2) Greater than 1.244? What is the type of operation in this case?
