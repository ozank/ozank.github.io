### A 380 V(l-l) 3-phase 4-pole Y-connected induction motor's torque-speed characteristics can be approximated as:
--

## \\(T\_m = k s = \dfrac{3 V^2}{r'\_2 \omega\_s} s\\)
--

### where \\(r'\_2 = 1 \Omega\\)/phase. The motor is used to drive a load at a precisely constant speed of 1500 rpm. 
--
The load torque can be expressed as:
### \\(T_L=\omega_r + 10 \\) Nm.

## a) Propose a method of speed control for this purpose and explain your reasoning, and calculate the required controller parameters.
--

## b) Calculate the operating slip of the motor.
--

## c) Give a rough estimate for the efficiency of the motor under these conditions.
--

## d) What is the minimum value of starting torque the motor must produce?

# Q2: Ahmet Rumeli Solved Problems: Q6.5

### A 6-pole, \\(215 \sqrt{3}\\), Y-connected, 60 Hz wound rotor induction motor has the following specifications
--

### Stator impedance: \\(Z\_1 = 0.2 + j0.38 \Omega\\)
### Referred Rotor impedance: \\(Z\_2' = 0.12 + j0.38 \Omega\\) at standstill

### The motor is used as a crane motor, which lifts and lowers a load that produces 160 Nm.


#### Neglect friction. Parallel branch moved to primary terminals

### a) While lifting the load at constant speed, find the stable operating slip?
--

### a2) What is the slip at maximum torque?

### b) While lifting the  load at constant speed, the supply voltage is cut and the load is left to move freely. What happens if the rated voltage is reapplied at slip:
--

### b1) Less than 1.244?
--

### b2) Greater than 1.244? What is the type of operation in this case?

### c) What is the minimum lifting speed which can be achieved by reducing the applied voltage? Find the voltage and the corresponding speed.
--

### d) With this new voltage, if you need to reduce the speed down to 600 rpm. What should be the value of the external resistance that is connected in series with the rotor resistance?
