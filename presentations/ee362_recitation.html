# CH1 - Q2:

### Consider a 3-phase cylindrical rotor type AC machine.
--

## Rotor: 2-pole, single-layer, full-pitched winding in 12 slots. Each coil side has 10 turns.
--

## Stator: 2-pole, double-layer 10/9 full-pitched winding in 18 slots. Each coil side has 15 turns.
--

## a) Draw the rotor and stator winding diagram
---
## The air-gap radius is 0.1 m, air-gap distance is 0.002 m, axial length 0.3 m

### Rotor is excited with:
#### \\(I\_a(t)= 10 cos (100 \pi t)\\)
####\\(I\_b(t)= 10 cos (100 \pi t - 2 \pi /3) \\)
####\\(I\_c(t)= 10 cos (100 \pi t - 4 \pi /3)\\)

## c) Calculate the generated first harmonic open-circuit rms stator phase voltage when the rotor speed is:

### i) Zero, ii) 3000 rpm, iii) -3000 rpm
---

# CH1 - Q2:

## The air-gap radius is 0.1 m, air-gap distance is 0.002 m, axial length 0.3 m


## d) When the rotor current is 5 A-peak, the generated first harmonic open-circuit rms stator phase voltage is 131.25 Vrms. Calculate the rotor speed.

# CH2 - Q4:
--

### The following observations are made on a 3-phase, 50-Hz, Y-connected, 380 V rms line-to-line induction motor with negligible stator winding resistance.
--

### i) At no-load the motor is rotating at 745 rpm.
--

## a) What is the number of poles of the machine?

# CH2 - Q4:

### The following observations are made on a 3-phase, 50-Hz, Y-connected, 380 V rms line-to-line induction motor with negligible stator winding resistance.

### i) At no-load the motor is rotating at 745 rpm.

### ii) The stator can not be started with a heavy load, but it only starts when the load torque is reduced to 236 Nm


### iii) When the motor is running at rated speed, the load is gradually increased and it is found that the rotor speed reduced down to 600 rpm, but after it decelerates and stops.
