# CH1 - Q2:

### Consider a 3-phase cylindrical rotor type AC machine.
--

## Rotor: 2-pole, single-layer, full-pitched winding in 12 slots. Each coil side has 10 turns.
--

## Stator: 2-pole, double-layer 10/9 full-pitched winding in 18 slots. Each coil side has 15 turns.
--

## a) Draw the rotor and stator winding diagram.
---
## The air-gap radius is 0.1 m, air-gap distance is 0.002 m, axial length 0.3 m

### Rotor is excited with:
#### \\(I\_a(t)= 10 cos (100 \pi t)\\)
####\\(I\_b(t)= 10 cos (100 \pi t - 2 \pi /3) \\)
####\\(I\_c(t)= 10 cos (100 \pi t - 4 \pi /3)\\)

## b) Draw the MMF distribution produced by the rotor at t=0.15 s.

# CH2 - Q4:
--

### The following observations are made on a 3-phase, 50-Hz, Y-connected, 380 V rms line-to-line induction motor with negligible stator winding resistance.
--

### i) At no-load the motor is rotating at 745 rpm.

# CH2 - Q4:

### The following observations are made on a 3-phase, 50-Hz, Y-connected, 380 V rms line-to-line induction motor with negligible stator winding resistance.

### i) At no-load the motor is rotating at 745 rpm.

### ii) The stator can not be started with a heavy load, but it only starts when the load torque is reduced to 236 Nm


### iii) When the motor is running at rated speed, the load is gradually increased and it is found that the rotor speed reduced down to 600 rpm, but after it decelerates and stops.

# ODTUClass

## A 10 hp 3-phase, 60 Hz, 6-pole squirrel-cage induction motor is used to drive a load at a slip of 3%. The friction and windage torque is measured to be 6.1 Nm at this slip. The torque requirement of the load varies as the cube of its speed and is 67.4 Nm at 1200 rpm.
--

## Compute the electromagnetical torque (Te), the power transferred across the air-gap (Pg), adn the rotor copper loss (Pcu2).

# Example

### A 480 V, 50 hp induction motor is drawing 60 A at 0.85 pf lagging.	
--
 The stator copper losses are 2kW and the rotor copper losses are 700W.

 The friction and windage losses are 600 W, the core losses are 1800 W and the stray losses are negligible, find:
--

- ### The air gap power.
--

- ### The converted power.
--

- ### The output power.
--

- ### The efficiency of the motor
--

- ### Torque of the motor
--

- ### Rotational speed of the rotor
