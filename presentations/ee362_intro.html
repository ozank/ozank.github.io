# Machine vs. Human

## Hamann: Almost no one comes down here, unless, of course, there's a problem. That's how it is with people - nobody cares how it works as long as it works. 

## I like it down here. I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines. 

## These machines are keeping us alive, while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting, isn't it? Power to give life, and the power to end it.

---
## Neo: But we control these machines, they don't control us. If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

## Hamann: Of course... that's it. You hit it! That's control, isn't it? If we wanted, we could smash them to bits. Although if we did, we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights, our heat, our air.
