## Software Tips

Here are some software that I use (and recommend):

* [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) to organize my research papers and references,
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ozank) for developing and publishing my work, [Dropbox](https://db.tt/eUKTasZ) and [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)to synchronize my files,
* [Vim](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-7-reasons-to-give-the-vim-text-editor-a-chance/) for programming and editing text,
* [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=3b0bbc32e797) to write papers, thesis etc.,
* [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) to plot pretty graphs, [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) as a replacement for Matlab,
* [FEMM](http://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage) and [Opera](http://operafea.com/), [ANSYS Maxwell](http://www.ansys.com/products/electronics/ansys-maxwell), [Comsol](https://www.comsol.com/) for electromagnetic FEA.
