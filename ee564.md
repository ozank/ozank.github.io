3- In the second part of the report, I want you to compare at least two worse  designs with the optimum design presented in the first part of your report. For example, you can vary one of the following:

- Number of rotor/stator slots
- Shape of the rotor/stator slots
- Winding diagram
- Aspect Ratio of the stator and rotor etc.

## First Project Topics (Deadline: 19/04):

- Operating Frequency: 500 Hz
- Input Voltage: 3 kV
- Output Voltage: 300kV
- Operating Temperature 110 °C

In this project you are supposed to design an eddy current brake design which will be used as a mechanical damper. Here are some links on the eddy current brakes:

- [Eddy Current Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1uRvErM80)
- [Eddy Current Brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake)
- [Eddy Current Brakes](http://www.explainthatstuff.com/eddy-current-brakes.html)

The eddy current brake has the following specs:

- Outer diameter smaller than 50 mm
- Axial Length shorter than 25 mm

You're free to choose any of the projects. Each project has different requirements and outcomes:

### Project outcomes for transformer designs:

The most important parameters are as follows (but not limited to):

- Design specifications of the core (geometry, material, total mass etc)
- Coil dimensions (number of turns, coil dimensions (in AWG), total wire length)
- Efficiency data (copper losses, core losses)
- Electrical parameters (resistance, inductance etc.)

### Notes on Projects

Your reports has to be [reproducible](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (i.e. it has to include codes, equations and results in a single document). The results have to be uploaded in an online repository (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com/)). For that purpose, I personally suggest [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). However, you can also use Mathematica, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or Matlab Report Generator, but not Microsoft Word. 

If you are convinced to use IPython, here are some useful links:

- Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads), for a quick start on Python.
- Use [Wakari](https://wakari.io), or [Sage](http://sagemath.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/ipython-notebooks-in-cloud-with.html) to use it online.
- [IPhyton Notebook basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb)
- [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
- [Reproducible reports with R](http://nicercode.github.io/guides/reports/)

The source files and reports has to be uploaded to the online repository of the course (i.e. [https://github.com/odtu/ee564](https://github.com/odtu/ee564). Have a look at [this link](http://ozan.keysan.me/okst/) for a quick start.

### Projects Grading

**Number of Commits:30%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you'll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you'll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage to start early and work regularly.

**Level of Information:50%:** The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

**Report Quality:20%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

## First Project Guidelines:

You're free to choose any of the projects. Each project has different project outcomes:

### 1- Design and manufacture an electric motor (or coil gun, or induction furnace)

Any topology is accepted as long as you built an actual working prototype. The  designs are not supposed to be professional, efficient, commercial-quality products. You can use make-shift components from junkyards etc. Your project will be evaluated in terms of the effort you put in. Project outcomes:

- A few photos showing the design process.
- A video of the working prototype (If you have an YouTube account, please  send me the link, otherwise I'll upload them to internet).
- A 1-2 page of summary that lists the materials used, working principle and the list of things that can be made to improve the performance.

### 2- Simulate the motion of two magnets repelling each other:

You're supposed to simulate the motion of two magnets placed as shown in the figure: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozank/ozank.github.io/master/presentations/magnet_repelling.png)

You are free to choose the dimensions and the properties of the magnet, but keep them realistic. One of the magnets can be fixed, or both of them can be floating. Don't neglect the gravity.

You don't have to, but I strongly advise you to use a FEA software (some options are listed above). If you don't have experience in FEA software before, [FEMM](http://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage) is a good start.

Project outcomes:

- Source files of the simulations (not large result files)
- Series of images that has been converted in an animation, or a video (make sure the images include magnetic flux lines, or other useful visuals)
- Graph showing the angular velocity and the linear speed of the magnets versus time.


If you're planning to use FEMM, then the [examples](http://www.femm.info/wiki/Examples) page is very useful. In particular, have a look at these three examples:

- [DC and AC Force of a Gapped EI-Core Inductor](http://www.femm.info/wiki/ACForceExample)
- [Force on a Taper Plunger Magnet](http://www.femm.info/wiki/RotersExample)
- [Coil Gun](http://www.femm.info/wiki/CoilGun)

### 3- Design a junk-yard magnet

You're supposed to design a junk-yard magnet, which is supposed to lift [standard sized metal sheets](http://www.metricmetal.com/product_locator/sheets_and_plates.htm)(you are free to choose which material to work with, but the magnet has to lift any sheet size of that material). The magnet can be energised by any source, but please explain how you obtain the required voltage from the standard 380 V AC supply.

Project outcomes:

- Design specifications of the core (geometry, material, total mass etc)
- Coil dimensions (number of turns, coil dimensions (in AWG), total wire length)
- Efficiency data (copper losses, core losses)
- Electrical parameters (resistance, inductance etc.)
