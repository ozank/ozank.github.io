## Lecture Hours
- Monday 16:40-17:30 D135
- Wednesday 13:40-15:30 D135

## Brief Info:
This course covers basic design principles of electrical machines. You will be able to design main parameters of an electric machine such as magnetic and electric loading, number of slots, winding dimensions. Thermal and structural design of electric machines will be also covered. You will use FEA software and optimization tools to determine the best parameters.

## Presentation Guidelines

- One topic should only be presented only once. First come first served, so please fill in the [online spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/173FqykIj7HfWxBJXid-JUIKdqOeXsMr1O3MJ19IN08g/edit?usp=sharing) asap.
- You are allowed to swap presentations dates later, but if you miss your scheduled slot, you will get 0. 
- Presentation duration: 15 minutes (+5 minutes for QA).
- You will be evaluated by you classmates using the following [score sheet](tba)
- An ideal presentation should cover the following aspects:
  * A short history
  * Main working principles of the machine
  * Differences from other machines
  * Advantages/Disadvantages
  * Application Areas
- You should prepare a handout for the audience. Please note that handouts are not the printed version of your slides. They should be in parallel with your slides, but should have more information. At the end of the handouts, there should be a reading list for detailed information on the topic.
- If you use other people's work (data, photo, table etc.), please cite them in your presentation. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- I prefer you to use online presentation tools, such as: [Google Slides](http://www.google.com/slides/about/), or [one of these tools](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-online-presentation-creation-tools-1681476445), but if you insist on using PowerPoint, then please send me a pdf copy of your slides, so I can put it on the course web-page.
- When preparing the slides, please have a look at these links:

## First Project Guidelines:

You're free to choose any of the projects. Each project has different project outcomes:

### 1- Design and manufacture an electric motor (or coil gun, or induction furnace)

You're supposed to an actual working prototype. Any topology is accepted. Your designs are not supposed to be professional, efficient, commercial-quality products. You can use materials from junkyards etc. Your project will be evaluated in terms of the effort you put in. Project outcomes:

- A few photos showing your design process.
- A video of the working prototype (If you have an YouTube account, you can send me a link, otherwise I'll upload them to internet)
- A 1-2 page of summary that lists the materials used, working principle and the list of things that can be made to improve performance.


### 2- Simulate the motion of two magnets repelling each other:



### 3- Design a junkyard magnet
