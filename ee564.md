- Monday 16:40-17:30 D135
- Wednesday 13:40-15:30 D135

## Brief Info:
This course covers basic design principles of electrical machines. You will be able to design main parameters of an electric machine such as magnetic and electric loading, number of slots, winding dimensions. Thermal and structural design of electric machines will be also covered. You will use FEA software and optimization tools to determine the best parameters.
